# BlackJack-V.1

## What was used:

  - Vanilla JS
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Bootstrap

## Controls

On the left hand side of the screen you will see the following:

  - Players Balance
  - Two Buttons to increase & decrease player bet size
  - A group of blue buttons (Deal, Hit, Stand, Double, Split)

If you know how to play blackjack this is fairly straight forward.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

  - Split is currently unavailable. 
  - There was a bug when calling the split function so it does not work!
  - Every now and then it was tell you that you lost when you won. (Not often)
  - ^ I believe this has to do with ace logic.
